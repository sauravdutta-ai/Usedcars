# 🚗 Used Cars Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the selling price of used cars based on various features like car brand, manufacturing year, fuel type, kilometers driven, and more. Built using Python and machine learning algorithms, the model assists potential car buyers and sellers in making informed pricing decisions.

---

## 📌 Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a regression model that can accurately predict the price of a used car based on relevant attributes. A clean, preprocessed dataset is used to train multiple models, and the best-performing one is selected based on performance metrics like R² score and RMSE.
